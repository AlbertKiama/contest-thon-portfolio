Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate technologist with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience across software development, networking, and system automation. I thrive on building robust, scalable solutions that bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
## This website is comprised of five major parts

** These technologies are limited at some point therefore it was hard to implement some functionalities in my website. Let's start with the different sections that are in my website.

- Home - This section has both navigation and hero. Both of this are structured and implemented using flex
- About - Also this structured and implemented using flex
- Skills - This is a special section which has both progress bar and grid used in its implementation
- Education - Also this part is very special and uses a special kind of teck called accordion, mostly accordion is used in FAQs but it fits very well here

- contacts - I have implemented this section using flex

All the sections are responsive to dirrefent screen sizes
